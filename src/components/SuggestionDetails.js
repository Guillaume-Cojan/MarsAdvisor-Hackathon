            <h3>Aurora Borealis</h3>
            <h5>Alyn Wallace Â· 2021-02-28</h5>
            <p>es, but can your tree do this?  Pictured is a visual coincidence between the dark branches of a nearby tree and bright glow of a distant aurora. The beauty of the aurora -- combined with how it seemed to mimic a tree right nearby -- mesmerized the photographer to such a degree that he momentarily forgot to take pictures. When viewed at the right angle, it seemed that this tree had aurora for leaves. Fortunately, before the aurora morphed into a different overall shape, he came to his senses and capture the awe-inspiring momentary coincidence.  Typically triggered by solar explosions, aurora are caused by high energy electrons impacting the Earth's atmosphere around 150 kilometers up.  The unusual Earth-sky collaboration was witnessed in March of 2017 in Iceland.    Almost Hyperspace: Random APOD Generator</p>
